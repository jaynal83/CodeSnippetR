# CodeSnippetR

The idea behind creating this repository is to create small snippet of R code which could be useful for larger project or any standalone tasks. I will continue to add code snipped with worked out example so that anyone can adapt based on their needs.

I will also update this readme file with appropriate of the actual worked out example posted in rpubs.

If you found this is useful, I would request you to leave a comment or even you can support through sponsorship options.

## List of Snippet with Examples

-   [Probability density](https://rpubs.com/jaynal83/densityplot) plot showing filled area for different quantile regions. The corresponding Rmarkdown file is in this repository and the URL contains the rendered version of it.
-   [Re-order factor labels](https://rpubs.com/jaynal83/reorderfactor) Organising factor labels as per your needs. You can change the order manually following this example.
